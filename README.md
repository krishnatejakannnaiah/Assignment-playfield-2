# assign

Kindly read 
Here are two folders 
1) One
2) Three

1) One - In One folder there will be two sub folders. In src you can find App.js and index.js files and other component files. and In public folder you can find index.html file.
As mentioned at the navbar the button was added to fetch and show the reqres APIs first page data, when the Get Users button is clicked at navbar, the the data will be showed in a 3 grid format. You can also find a loader showed while the API data is in process of fetching. If it couldn't able to be seen as the API data is loaded very quicker you go through the console for an acknowledgement or you can also check with the code. To make it simple I have written some structured and clean code. It was done using ReactJS, API was fetched using fetch() global functions. As mentioned I haven't used any CSS framework.

2) Three - The todo app where we can able to drag the elements and should able to merge them in other components. It was done making all the elements draggable have used functions to able to drop them in other divs (drag and drop functions). It was written using JS, html and CSS.

Thank you.
